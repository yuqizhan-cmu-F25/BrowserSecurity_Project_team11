## What's Being Collected

CNN is primarily tracking **how you interact with their website** — specifically monitoring your clicks, scrolling behavior, and how elements on the page resize or change as you browse. The massive number of `setAttribute` calls (7,047 uses) indicates the site is constantly modifying links and content based on your actions. The `ResizeObserver` features (1,203+ uses) are watching how page elements resize, which helps them understand which content areas you're viewing and for how long. The `classList` and `dataset` operations suggest they're tagging elements with information about your behavior for later analysis.

## How It's Being Collected

These JavaScript features work together like invisible observers. When you click links, the site records that action through `setAttribute`. When you scroll or resize your browser, `ResizeObserver` detects what's visible on your screen. The `dataset` feature allows the site to attach hidden labels to page elements (like ""user clicked here"" or ""ad was viewed""). This data is then typically sent to analytics services and advertisers to build a profile of your browsing habits.

## Privacy Implications & Normalcy

This level of tracking is **completely typical for major news websites like CNN**, though it's worth knowing about. The data collected helps CNN understand which stories you read, how long you stay, and which ads you see — information they use for advertising targeting and to improve their site. While not inherently malicious, this does mean your reading habits are being monitored and potentially shared with advertisers. If privacy concerns you, consider using browser privacy modes, ad blockers, or privacy-focused browsers to limit this tracking.",6134,40203

## What Data Is Being Collected

Amazon is collecting detailed information about your browsing session and behavior on their website. The key data points include:

- **Session identifiers** (`ue_sid`, `ue_mid`) that create a unique fingerprint of your visit
- **Timestamp data** (`ue_t0`) tracking exactly when you arrived and what you do
- **Market and regional information** (`ue_mkt`) about your location
- **Sensitive information tags** (`csm_sensitive_info`) that flag pages containing personal data like your account details, payment info, or order history
- **Page structure mapping** (the repeated `nodeType` and `length` features) that records what elements are on each page you visit

## How It's Being Collected

Amazon uses JavaScript code that runs directly in your browser to inspect the webpage structure and monitor your interactions. Features like `Window.ue` (their user experience tracking system) act as a central hub collecting this data. The `csm_node_id` tags allow Amazon to categorize and track specific UI elements, while the DOM inspection features (nodeType, length) let them understand exactly what content you're viewing. This data is collected automatically without requiring explicit user actions—it happens just by visiting the site.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

This level of tracking is **typical for major e-commerce sites** like Amazon, but it's quite extensive. Amazon uses this data to optimize your shopping experience, show personalized recommendations, and improve their website—but it also creates a detailed profile of your browsing habits, interests, and sensitive activities. The tracking of ""sensitive information"" pages is particularly notable, as it means Amazon knows when you're viewing your account, payment methods, or order history. This is generally legal under their terms of service, though privacy-conscious users may want to use browser privacy tools or extensions to limit this tracking.",770,5465

## What's Being Collected

Target is collecting detailed information about your browsing behavior on their website. This includes tracking which products you view, how long you spend looking at items, what you click on, and the path you take through their site. They're also monitoring your device's performance metrics and timing data, which helps them understand how fast pages load and how you interact with their interface. Additionally, they're capturing information from your URL (the web address bar), which can include search terms, product IDs, and other parameters that reveal what you're looking for.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking happens through several technical methods. The heavy use of **React** (a programming framework—indicated by the `__reactContainer`, `__reactFiber`, and `__reactProps` features with over 90,000 combined uses) means Target is building an interactive website that constantly monitors every click and interaction. **Performance.now** (used 6,946 times) tracks millisecond-level timing data about your behavior. **URLSearchParams.set** (10,608 uses) captures and modifies the data in your web address to track what you're searching for. **addEventListener** (20,460 uses) sets up listeners that record virtually every interaction you have with the page.

## Privacy Implications & Normality

This level of tracking is fairly typical for large retail websites like Target, but it's still quite extensive. The data collected helps Target personalize your shopping experience and improve their website, but it also creates a detailed profile of your shopping interests and behavior. This information is likely shared with advertising partners and used to show you targeted ads across the internet.

## What's Being Tracked

Best Buy is collecting detailed information about how you interact with their website. The primary tracking involves **user behavior monitoring** — specifically, they're recording what you click on, how you move your mouse, what you look at on the page, and how long you spend viewing different sections. They're also collecting **performance data** about your browser and device, including timing information about how fast pages load and which elements take longest to display.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking is happening through a service called **ContentSquare** (visible in the code references like `__contentsquare_identifier` and `__contentsquare_sensitive`). This is a session replay and analytics tool that essentially creates a digital recording of your browsing session. The features being used include timing measurements (`Performance.now`, `PerformanceResourceTiming.startTime`) to track when things happen, and detailed inspection of page elements (`HTMLDivElement`, `tagName`, `shadowRoot`) to understand what you're viewing and interacting with. The sheer volume of tracking (651,359 total feature uses) indicates this monitoring is nearly continuous while you browse.

## Privacy Implications & Normalcy

This level of tracking is fairly typical for large e-commerce sites like Best Buy, but it does mean your browsing behavior, clicks, and even mouse movements are being recorded and analyzed — potentially including sensitive information like products you viewed but didn't buy, or pages you visited. While this data helps companies improve their websites, it also enables targeted advertising and behavioral profiling.

## The Technical Foundation

The New York Times website is built using React, a popular framework that heavily manipulates page elements to create an interactive experience. The massive number of feature uses (over 416,000) reveals constant activity: creating new page elements, moving content around, and tracking how you interact with articles and ads. The repeated use of `CustomEvent` features (over 13,500 times) indicates the site is sending internal messages to itself—essentially creating a detailed log of your actions like clicking, scrolling, and reading.

## What Data Is Being Collected

NYTimes is collecting behavioral data about your engagement: which articles you view, how long you spend on each one, where you click, and how you navigate the site. The `CustomEvent.status` and `CustomEvent.detail` features are particularly telling—these are used to track state changes and pass information about your interactions through the system. This data feeds into their subscription model (knowing what content engages you), ad targeting (showing you relevant ads), and content recommendations.

## Privacy Implications & Context

While this level of tracking might feel invasive, it's **completely standard for major news websites**, especially paywalled services like the Times. They use this data to personalize your experience, improve their service, and generate revenue through targeted advertising. However, this data is typically combined with information from third-party trackers (Google Analytics, ad networks, etc.) that aren't visible in this JavaScript analysis.

## The Data Being Collected

The Washington Post is collecting detailed information about how you interact with their website. This includes tracking which pages you visit (via `Location.href` and `Window.location`), monitoring your mouse movements and clicks (via `Window.event`), and recording how long you spend on different parts of the page (via `Performance.now`). They're also tracking when you receive messages or notifications from the site, and monitoring how you resize or scroll through content.

## How They're Doing It

The site uses several JavaScript techniques to gather this data. The most prominent is constant monitoring of your browser's location and events—essentially watching every action you take. They're also dynamically creating and modifying page elements (`createElement`, `setAttribute`, `appendChild`), which allows them to insert tracking code throughout the page. The heavy use of `requestAnimationFrame` and `Performance.now` suggests they're measuring page performance and user engagement in real-time, tracking millisecond-level timing data about your interactions.

## Privacy Implications & Context

This level of tracking is fairly typical for major news websites like the Washington Post, especially those with subscription models and advertising. They use this data to understand reader behavior, personalize content, target ads, and measure engagement metrics. However, the sheer volume (over 120,000 feature uses) shows this is comprehensive surveillance of your browsing session. While not necessarily malicious, it means your reading habits, interests, and behavior patterns are being recorded and likely shared with advertisers and analytics companies.

## What's Being Collected

Forbes is heavily analyzing your interactions with page content and tracking how you navigate their website. The site is monitoring which articles you click on, how you scroll through content, which elements you hover over or interact with, and how long you spend viewing different sections. This behavioral data creates a detailed profile of your reading habits and interests.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking happens through constant inspection of the webpage's structure using JavaScript. Features like `nextSibling`, `firstChild`, and `tagName` (used thousands of times each) allow the site to map out every element on the page and monitor when you interact with it. The `classList` and `contains` functions track when elements change state—like when you click a button or expand a menu. The `__reactProps` reference indicates Forbes uses React (a popular web framework) to build interactive features that can quietly log every user action. Essentially, the site is watching what you click, read, and how you move through their content in real-time.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

This level of tracking is **typical for major news websites like Forbes**, but that doesn't mean it's privacy-friendly. Your reading history and interests are collected and often shared with advertisers, data brokers, and third-party analytics companies to build targeted advertising profiles. Over time, this data reveals sensitive information about your political views, health concerns, financial interests, and personal beliefs. While some tracking is necessary for basic website functionality, the scale here (377,880 feature uses) suggests aggressive monitoring well beyond what's needed.

TechCrunch is primarily collecting **timing and performance data** about how you interact with their website, along with detailed information about your browser's document structure. The heavy use of `Performance.now()` (11,203 uses) indicates they're measuring precise timestamps of your actions—essentially creating a detailed timeline of when you click, scroll, load content, and move your mouse. They're also analyzing the structure of web page elements you view through features like `tagName`, `nodeType`, and `nodeValue`, which reveals what specific content you're looking at and how long you spend on different sections.

## How It's Being Collected

These measurements happen automatically through JavaScript code running in your browser. `Performance.now()` creates microsecond-level timestamps, while the DOM (Document Object Model) features like `createDocumentFragment` and `firstChild` allow scripts to track which articles, ads, and page elements you're viewing. This isn't requiring any special permissions—it's all happening silently in the background as you browse. The data is likely being sent to analytics services (Google Analytics, Chartbeat, or similar) to understand user behavior patterns.

HuffPost is using multiple layers of tracking technology to monitor your behavior on the site. The most significant tracker is **MOAT** (Measurement of Advertising Technology), which appears 731 times in the code. MOAT is an ad verification tool that tracks what ads you see, how long you look at them, and whether you interact with them. This data helps advertisers measure whether their ads are actually being viewed by real people. Additionally, **OneTrust** (703 uses) is their consent management system—it's supposed to track and respect your privacy choices, but it also collects data about your preferences and consent decisions.

The site is also collecting basic information about page elements through repeated use of attribute readers (`Attr.name` and `Attr.value` - over 5,700 combined uses). These features examine the HTML structure of the page to identify what content you're viewing, which ads are present, and how the page is organized. The site uses **jQuery** (over 1,400 uses) to manipulate page content and track interactions, and **Crypto.getRandomValues** (496 uses) to generate unique identifiers that follow you across sessions—essentially creating a fingerprint to recognize you when you return.

**Is this typical?** Yes, unfortunately this is standard for major news websites. HuffPost relies on advertising revenue, so ad tracking is expected. However, the sheer volume (41,714 total feature uses) suggests aggressive tracking beyond just basic analytics.

## What's Being Tracked

ESPN is primarily collecting **behavioral data about how you interact with their website** — specifically, tracking which images and content you're viewing and how you're scrolling through the page. They're also monitoring your device's screen dimensions and how elements are positioned on your screen. This data helps them understand what content captures your attention and how you navigate their site.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking happens through several JavaScript techniques: `getBoundingClientRect` (used 2,642+ times) checks the exact position of images and content on your screen to see if they're visible to you; `getAttribute` retrieves information about those images; `getComputedStyle` examines the visual styling of elements; and various DOM properties track the structure of the page. Essentially, ESPN's code is constantly taking ""snapshots"" of what's on your screen and what's visible in your viewport as you scroll. This is often called **""lazy loading""** (note the `_lazyRace` feature) — a technique that loads images only when you're about to see them, which also conveniently tracks your scrolling behavior.

## Privacy Implications & Normalcy

While this tracking is **typical for major news and sports websites**, it does create a detailed map of your browsing behavior — which articles you linger on, which videos you watch, and how long you spend on different sections. This data is valuable for advertisers and can be combined with other tracking methods (cookies, pixels) to build a profile of your interests.

## What's Being Tracked

Weather.com is collecting data about how you interact with the website and your browsing behavior. The site is monitoring your clicks and movements on the page, tracking how long you spend viewing content, recording which URLs you visit within the site, and observing changes to the page content as you navigate. This information helps them understand user behavior patterns and can be used for analytics, advertising targeting, and site optimization.

## How It's Being Collected

The site uses several JavaScript techniques to gather this data. **Performance.now** (2,643 uses) measures precise timing information to track how long pages take to load and how long you spend on different sections. **MutationRecord.type** (2,658 uses) monitors when page content changes, helping track which features you interact with. **Window.location and Location.hash** (1,233 uses each) record which pages you visit and track your navigation path through the site. **NodeList and HTMLCollection features** repeatedly scan the page structure to identify and monitor interactive elements. **HTMLScriptElement.getAttribute** (1,214 uses) inspects scripts on the page—often used to detect and load third-party tracking tools from advertisers and analytics companies.

## Privacy Implications & Normalcy

This level of tracking is **typical for weather websites**, which rely on advertising revenue and use analytics to understand user behavior. However, the high number of feature uses (54,913 total) suggests multiple tracking systems are active simultaneously—likely including Google Analytics, weather-specific analytics, and ad networks.

## What's Being Tracked

Yelp is primarily collecting **performance and interaction data** about how you use their website. The dominant tracking involves monitoring your mouse movements, clicks, scrolling behavior, and how long you spend on different parts of pages. They're also tracking timing data—measuring milliseconds between your actions to understand your browsing patterns and engagement levels. Additionally, the site is monitoring which elements you interact with (buttons, reviews, maps, etc.) and how the page layout responds to your actions.

## How It's Being Collected

The JavaScript features reveal the tracking methods: `Performance.now()` is used extensively (7,547 times) to create precise timestamps of your activity, while `Performance.timeOrigin` establishes baseline timing. The numerous DOM (Document Object Model) features like `HTMLDivElement.parentNode`, `setAttribute`, and `style` modifications show Yelp tracking which page elements you're viewing and interacting with. The `__reactProps` reference indicates they're using React (a web framework) to deeply monitor component interactions. `HTMLDocument.currentScript` helps them track which scripts are running and when. Essentially, they're building a detailed map of your journey through their site—what you click, how long you linger, and what captures your attention.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

This level of tracking is **typical for major websites like Yelp**, but it does mean your browsing behavior is being recorded and likely combined with other data (your searches, location, reviews you read) to build a profile used for personalization and advertising. While most of this data is anonymized, it can still be sensitive—your interests in specific restaurants, neighborhoods, or services reveal personal preferences.

## What's Being Collected

Based on these JavaScript features, Netflix is primarily collecting **behavioral data about how you interact with their website** — specifically tracking your clicks, movements, animations, and how you navigate through content. The heavy use of React properties (`__reactProps` and `__reactFiber`) indicates Netflix is monitoring every element you interact with on the page, from buttons you hover over to content you browse. The `TextDecoder` feature suggests they're also processing encoded data, potentially including information about your viewing patterns or account activity.

## How It's Being Collected

Netflix uses several tracking methods here: **React instrumentation** (the most-used features) allows them to track DOM interactions in real-time as you click through their interface; **animation tracking** (`AnimationEvent.target`) monitors when you trigger page transitions or hover effects; and **idle detection** (`IdleDeadline.timeRemaining`) tracks when you're actively using the site versus inactive. These aren't traditional cookies or third-party trackers — they're first-party tracking built directly into Netflix's own website code, which is technically legal since you agreed to their terms.

## Privacy Implications & Normalcy

**This is extremely typical for Netflix and most modern streaming services.** They need to track your behavior to recommend shows, optimize their interface, and understand viewing habits — it's core to their business model. However, the scale (71,000+ feature uses) shows comprehensive monitoring of nearly every interaction. The good news: this data stays within Netflix's systems rather than being sold to advertisers. The concern: Netflix builds detailed profiles of your preferences and viewing patterns, which they use for recommendations and potentially share with content creators. For a streaming service, this level of tracking is standard practice, though you can limit some data collection through Netflix's privacy settings.",3852,71343

## What's Being Tracked

Based on the JavaScript features detected, Hulu is primarily collecting information about **how you interact with their website** — specifically tracking your mouse movements, clicks, and how you navigate through content. The site is also monitoring your device's screen size and responsive design behavior to understand what content looks like on your particular device. While this data doesn't directly identify you by name, it creates a detailed profile of your browsing behavior on their site.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking happens through several technical methods: The repeated use of **CSSStyleRule.type** and **CSSMediaRule.type** (over 8,000 combined uses) indicates Hulu is constantly monitoring your device's screen dimensions and how the website adapts to different screen sizes — this helps them understand what you're viewing and on what device. The **HTMLDivElement** features (which appear 606+ times each) show that Hulu is using React, a popular web framework, to track every element you interact with on the page. The specific React internal properties (`__reactEventHandlers` and `__reactInternalInstance`) are particularly telling — these allow the site to monitor clicks, hovers, and other interactions with extreme granularity.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

This level of interaction tracking is **typical for streaming services like Hulu**, but it does mean the company builds a detailed picture of your viewing habits, what you click on, how long you hover over content, and your device information. This data is valuable for personalizing recommendations and targeted advertising. While this is standard practice for entertainment websites, it's worth knowing that your behavior on Hulu is being carefully monitored and likely shared with advertising partners.

## What's Being Collected

Twitch is collecting extensive data about your behavior and interactions on the site. The dominant feature (`HTMLDivElement.__reactProps$2ojls2fsmmg` with 13,103 uses) indicates React is tracking every interactive element you interact with—buttons you click, videos you watch, streams you browse, and UI elements you hover over. The repeated use of `HTMLScriptElement.getAttribute` (appearing multiple times in the top features) shows Twitch is reading script tags and their attributes, likely to load and execute tracking scripts from third parties. Additionally, `Performance.now` (5,604 uses) is measuring precise timing data about how you use the site—how long you spend on pages, how quickly you interact with content, and performance metrics that reveal your browsing patterns.

## How It's Being Collected

These features work together as a sophisticated tracking system. React's property tracking captures your every interaction with the interface. The `Window.__twilightSettings` entries (appearing twice with 1,376 uses each) suggest Twitch's internal configuration system is managing tracking parameters. The frequent creation of new HTML elements (`HTMLDocument.createElement` with 1,459 uses) indicates dynamic loading of tracking pixels, analytics code, and advertisement scripts—these are invisible trackers injected into the page to monitor your activity and report it back to Twitch and its advertising partners.

## Privacy Implications & Normalcy

This level of tracking is **typical for Twitch** but represents significant privacy collection. The data gathered—what you watch, how long you watch, what you click, your viewing patterns—creates a detailed profile used for targeted advertising and content recommendations. While this is standard for free streaming platforms that rely on ad revenue, it means your viewing habits are continuously monitored and shared with advertisers.

## What's Being Collected

Based on these JavaScript features, Reddit is primarily collecting data about **how you interact with the page content** — specifically tracking which text, elements, and sections you're viewing or engaging with. The heavy use of DOM navigation features (like `nextSibling`, `firstChild`, and `tagName`) suggests Reddit is monitoring what content you scroll through, hover over, or click on. This helps them understand which posts, comments, and ads capture your attention.

## How It's Being Collected

Reddit uses DOM (Document Object Model) traversal techniques — essentially ""walking through"" the page structure to identify and track every element you interact with. The `TreeWalker` functions are particularly telling; they systematically scan through page content to build a map of what's visible and what you're engaging with. `HTMLDocument.defaultView` helps connect this tracking to your specific browser session. This is more sophisticated than simple click tracking — it's analyzing the actual structure and flow of content you consume.

## Privacy Implications & Normalcy

**This level of tracking is typical for Reddit and most modern social media platforms**, though it's worth noting. Reddit uses this data to: personalize your feed, target ads, measure engagement, and improve recommendations. The good news is these features alone don't directly capture personal information like your name or location. The concerning part is that when combined with your Reddit account, browsing history, and IP address, this creates a detailed profile of your interests and behavior — which Reddit sells to advertisers. This is standard practice for free platforms, but it's why many users consider Reddit a privacy trade-off for free access.",15477,168486

Pinterest is primarily tracking **how you interact with the website** — specifically monitoring your mouse movements, clicks, scrolling behavior, and which elements you hover over or engage with. The site is also collecting data about **what content you view, how long you stay on items, and how the page layout changes as you browse**. This behavioral data helps Pinterest understand your interests and preferences.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking happens through several JavaScript techniques:

- **Visual interaction monitoring** (the `style`, `zIndex`, `opacity`, and `transform` features with ~145,000+ combined uses) tracks when you interact with pins, hover over content, or trigger animations — essentially recording every visual change tied to your actions.
- **DOM mutation tracking** (the `MutationRecord` features with 33,659 uses) watches for changes to the page structure itself, detecting when new content loads, pins appear, or layouts shift — this reveals what content you're viewing and for how long.
- **Element inspection** (tagName, nextSibling features) identifies exactly what type of content you're engaging with, distinguishing between images, ads, pins, and other page elements.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

This level of detailed interaction tracking is **typical for Pinterest** and most social media platforms, but it's quite extensive. Pinterest uses this data to build a detailed profile of your interests, which directly feeds their recommendation algorithm and targeted advertising system. While this tracking is standard for free social platforms, it means Pinterest knows not just *what* you looked at, but *how* you looked at it — your hesitations, your focus points, and your engagement patterns.

Instagram is extensively monitoring **how you interact with the site** in real-time. The dominant features here—particularly `Window.TimeSlice` (used over 10,000 times) and `Performance.now` (nearly 6,400 times)—are constantly measuring *timing data*. This means Instagram is tracking precisely when you click, scroll, pause, or move your mouse, and how long you spend on each action. Think of it like having someone with a stopwatch watching your every move on the page. Additionally, `AnimationEvent.type` and `Event.type` are monitoring what specific actions you're performing—whether you're clicking buttons, typing, or interacting with videos.

The `Window.ErrorGuard` and module factory functions (`__onBeforeModuleFactory`, `__onAfterModuleFactory`) indicate Instagram is also tracking **how the website loads and functions for you specifically**. This helps them understand if certain features work smoothly for your device or browser, but it also means they're collecting detailed behavioral fingerprints. Combined, these 637 unique features create an incredibly detailed profile of not just *what* you do on Instagram, but *exactly how* and *when* you do it—your browsing patterns, hesitations, re-reads, and engagement intensity.

**Is this normal?** Yes, unfortunately—this level of tracking is typical for Instagram and similar social media platforms. However, it goes well beyond simple analytics.

## What's Actually Happening

Based on the JavaScript features being used, Discord is primarily **not** engaged in traditional tracking like many ad-supported websites. Instead, the data collection here is almost entirely focused on **making the website work and function smoothly**. The heavy use of styling features (HTMLDivElement.style, CSSStyleDeclaration properties like transform, opacity, and willChange) indicates Discord is constantly adjusting visual elements—animations, transitions, and layout changes as you scroll, hover, or interact with messages and UI elements. The `requestAnimationFrame` feature shows the site is running smooth animations at 60 frames per second.

## The Privacy Picture

What you're *not* seeing in this list are the typical tracking features that would indicate advertising networks or third-party data brokers collecting your behavior (like pixel trackers or cross-site cookies). However, this doesn't mean Discord isn't collecting data—it almost certainly is through other means not visible in this JavaScript feature list, such as server-side logging of your messages, connections, and account activity. The features shown here are mostly about **performance and user experience**, not surveillance. Discord does collect metadata about your usage for its own business purposes, but this particular code analysis suggests the website isn't heavily instrumented with the kind of third-party tracking pixels you'd find on news sites or shopping platforms.

## Is This Normal?

Yes, this is completely typical for a modern web application like Discord. A real-time communication platform needs to constantly update the visual interface as messages arrive, users come online, and animations play.

## What's Being Tracked

Slack is collecting data about how you interact with their website, including which elements you click on, how you navigate pages, and your browsing patterns. The most significant tracker is **Drift** (2,185 uses), which is a customer engagement and chat tool that monitors your behavior to offer live support and personalized messaging. Additionally, Slack is tracking basic information about your browser, device type, and how you move through their site.

## How It's Being Collected

The website uses several JavaScript techniques to gather this data. The heavy use of `querySelectorAll` (4,377 uses) and `NodeList.length` allows the site to scan and monitor every interactive element on the page—buttons, links, forms. The frequent use of `getAttribute` on links (536 uses) means Slack is recording details about where links point and what they're labeled. The `Window.drift` feature is particularly notable: this third-party service tracks your mouse movements, clicks, time spent on pages, and browsing history to build a profile of your behavior. Creating new HTML elements (`createElement`) and modifying them (`setAttribute`) suggests dynamic tracking code is being injected into pages to monitor your actions in real-time.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

This level of tracking is **typical for a B2B SaaS company like Slack**, though it does mean your browsing behavior on their website is being monitored and profiled. The Drift integration is especially common for companies wanting to offer targeted customer support and sales outreach. If you're not logged in, this data is typically tied to your IP address or a tracking cookie; if you are logged in, it's directly linked to your account. While this isn't necessarily malicious, you should know that your interactions are being recorded to personalize your experience and inform their sales and support strategies.",3865,38822

## What Data is Being Collected

Based on the JavaScript features detected, Zoom's website is collecting several types of information about your visit:

1. **Your browsing behavior** - The site tracks which links you click (HTMLAnchorElement.href and addEventListener show 874+ uses), what pages you visit, and how you interact with the site
2. **Performance and timing data** - PerformanceResourceTiming.name (710 uses) indicates the site is monitoring how quickly pages load and which resources take longest to load
3. **Your device and how you use it** - RequestAnimationFrame (1,070+ combined uses) and transform properties (465 uses) suggest tracking of mouse movements, scrolling, animations, and other interactive behaviors

## How It's Being Collected

The site uses standard web APIs to gather this data passively as you browse. The heavy use of ""addEventListener"" functions means the site is listening for your clicks and interactions. URL.hostname tracking (874 uses) suggests it's monitoring which external websites you might navigate to from Zoom's site. The high number of Array and Function uses (over 2,400 combined) indicates complex data processing happening behind the scenes to organize and analyze all this collected information.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

**This level of tracking is fairly typical for a major corporate website like Zoom**, though the sheer volume (37,403 total feature uses) suggests fairly aggressive data collection. This data is likely used for analytics, advertising optimization, and understanding user behavior—but it could also be shared with third-party services.

## What's Being Tracked

Microsoft.com is heavily monitoring how you interact with the page itself—tracking which elements you hover over, click on, and how the page content changes as you browse. The site is also observing your mouse movements and scrolling behavior through DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation. Additionally, the site appears to be collecting data about your browser environment and how different page components load and render.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking happens through several JavaScript techniques. The repeated use of `NodeList.length` (8,658 times) and `MutationRecord.addedNodes` (over 4,000 times combined) indicates the site is constantly monitoring when new elements appear on the page—this typically tracks user interactions like clicks, hovers, and navigation. The heavy use of `shadowRoot` properties (over 5,000 uses) suggests the site is inspecting hidden UI components and tracking interactions within them. `getAttribute` calls (over 3,300 uses) show the site is reading element properties to understand what you're clicking on and interacting with. This level of monitoring goes well beyond simple analytics—it's detailed behavioral tracking.

## Privacy Implications & Normalcy

While this level of interaction tracking is somewhat typical for large corporate websites like Microsoft's (which owns multiple services and wants to understand user behavior), it's worth noting that 66,000+ feature uses from 1,115 different JavaScript features suggests sophisticated, multi-layered tracking. This data could be used to build detailed profiles of your browsing patterns, interests, and behavior—information valuable for advertising, product development, or cross-site tracking if Microsoft shares data with partners.

## What's Being Collected

Based on the JavaScript features being used, Apple.com is primarily collecting information about **how you navigate and interact with the website**. This includes tracking which links you click on, where those links point to, and how you move around the page. The site is also monitoring your browser's location information (what website you're currently on) and examining the structure of the page itself.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking happens through several common JavaScript techniques: **Location tracking** uses `Window.location` and `Location.hostname` (736 uses each) to record what page you're viewing. **Link monitoring** uses `HTMLAnchorElement` features (over 4,000 combined uses) to inspect every link on the page—checking where links point to, what attributes they have, and whether they're external or internal links. **Page structure analysis** uses `HTMLElement.contains` and `NodeList.length` (over 2,200 uses) to understand how elements are organized on the page and track user interactions with them.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

This level of tracking is **very typical for major websites** like Apple.com and is generally considered standard practice. The data being collected helps Apple understand user behavior (which products people are interested in, navigation patterns) to improve the website experience and inform marketing decisions. However, this information could potentially be combined with other data (like your Apple ID if you're logged in, or cookies tracking you across the web) to build a detailed profile of your interests and browsing habits.

## What Data Is Being Collected

Google is collecting information about how you interact with their webpage and details about your device. Specifically, they're tracking which elements you interact with on the page (through the `__jsaction` feature), your browser type and operating system (via `Navigator.userAgent`), and how you navigate through different parts of the page. They're also monitoring the structure of how you move through their interface—essentially mapping your clicks and movements.

## How It's Being Collected

The bulk of the tracking happens through what's called ""DOM manipulation""—this is JavaScript constantly examining and recording the structure of the webpage and your interactions with it. The repeated use of features like `parentNode`, `parentElement`, and `hasAttribute` (which appear hundreds of times each) shows Google's code is continuously inspecting what you're clicking on and where you're navigating. The `__jsaction` feature is particularly important—it's Google's internal system for tracking user interactions with specific page elements. Your browser information (`userAgent`) is also being collected to identify what device and browser you're using.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

While this level of tracking might seem extensive, it's actually **typical for Google's homepage**. Google needs to understand how people use their search interface to improve it, and this data helps them optimize button placement, search suggestions, and overall usability. However, it's worth noting that Google combines this behavioral data with other information they collect across the web (through ads, Gmail, YouTube, etc.) to build a detailed profile of your interests and habits. For a search engine homepage specifically, this tracking is standard practice, though privacy-conscious users may want to consider privacy-focused search alternatives if they're concerned about data collection.",2737,27500

## What's Being Collected

Based on these JavaScript features, GitHub is primarily collecting **performance metrics and user interaction data** rather than traditional personal information. The heavy use of `Performance.now()` (9,150 times) indicates the site is measuring how fast different parts of the page load and respond to your actions. The repeated use of `querySelector` and `matches` functions (over 27,000 combined uses) shows the site is constantly monitoring which elements you're interacting with—tracking clicks, hovers, and navigation patterns to understand how you use the interface.

## How It's Being Collected

GitHub is using standard web APIs to track your behavior in real-time. `CustomElementRegistry.get` (over 30,000 uses) helps the site identify and monitor custom interactive components you engage with. The `HTMLCollection.length` and various DOM element queries allow GitHub to track what content you're viewing and how long you spend on different sections. Essentially, the site is taking detailed snapshots of your interactions—measuring response times, tracking which buttons you click, and monitoring your navigation patterns.

## Privacy Implications & Context

This type of tracking is **typical and relatively low-risk** for a technical platform like GitHub. The data collected appears focused on improving user experience and site performance rather than selling your information to advertisers. However, this interaction data is still being stored and could theoretically be linked to your account. For GitHub specifically, this is standard practice—they use this information to optimize the platform and identify bugs.

## What's Actually Happening

Based on the JavaScript features being used, Stack Overflow is primarily engaged in **performance monitoring and user interface optimization** rather than traditional tracking. The top features—like `willChange`, `getComputedStyle`, and `MutationRecord`—are tools for monitoring how the webpage displays and responds to user interactions. Think of it like the website constantly checking its own pulse to see how fast it's running and how users are interacting with buttons, text, and other page elements. This data helps Stack Overflow understand when the site is slow or buggy so they can fix it.

## How It Works

The website uses several technical methods to gather this information: it watches for changes to the page layout (`MutationRecord`), checks how elements are styled and positioned (`CSSStyleDeclaration`, `getComputedStyle`), and monitors the browser's performance. These aren't directly collecting personal information like your name or location—they're more like internal sensors measuring the website's health and responsiveness. However, this behavioral data *could* be combined with other tracking methods (like cookies or analytics services) that aren't visible in this particular list.

## Privacy Perspective

This type of monitoring is **typical and generally low-risk** for a website like Stack Overflow. Performance monitoring is standard practice for modern websites. However, the privacy concern depends on whether this data is sent to third parties or combined with personal identifiers. If Stack Overflow is only using this internally to improve their service, it's relatively benign. But if this behavioral data is linked to your account or shared with advertisers, it becomes more invasive.

Additionally, the site is tracking **how you interact with page elements** (via `hasAttribute` checks), **what content you view**, and **how your browser processes information** (TextDecoder usage suggests analyzing encoded data, possibly analytics payloads).

## How It's Being Collected

Medium uses standard web APIs to gather this data: it monitors your clicks and interactions with page elements (HTMLDivElement features), tracks which articles or content sections you engage with, and uses JavaScript to send this behavioral data back to their servers. The TextDecoder feature suggests they're processing compressed or encoded tracking data before transmitting it. This is all done automatically in the background as you browse—you don't explicitly consent to each individual data collection event.

The site monitors which links you click on, how you navigate the page, and what content you engage with. This interaction data helps them understand user behavior patterns and optimize their website experience.

## How It's Being Collected

The tracking happens through several JavaScript methods working together:

- **Link monitoring** (`HTMLAnchorElement` features with 181+ uses): Every time you hover over or click a link, the site records this action through event listeners (`addEventListener`). The site checks properties like `nodeType` and `nodeName` to identify which links you're interacting with.
- **Page structure analysis** (`HTMLCollection.length`, `NodeList.length`): The site counts and catalogs all interactive elements on the page to understand what's available to track.
- **Script and metadata inspection** (`HTMLScriptElement.getAttribute`, `HTMLMetaElement.getAttribute`): The site examines its own tracking scripts and configuration settings to ensure tracking is working correctly.

## Privacy Implications & Typicality

This type of tracking is **very common and relatively standard** for a major website like WordPress.com. The good news is that this appears to be behavioral tracking (what you click) rather than personal identification tracking (who you are). However, when combined with account login data, WordPress could potentially link this behavior to your identity.
